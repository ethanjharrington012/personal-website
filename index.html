                <h1>What I beleive</h1>
                <strong><small>Working hard and being authentic</small></strong>
                <p>Ever since I was a child I was told, "If your gonna do a job, do it right." I beleive I have stood by that philosophy.
                    I think there is something to say about integrity.  I want to uphold my end of that even if the other half doesn't.
                    Working takes up most of societies day to day. I don't want to be a different person with my family and freinds then I am at work.
                    I will also not take a job if I don't see a genuine use for that position, or if there is no oportuniy for future growth.
                    Being stagnant is the devil for what I understand it to be.

                <p>From when I can remember I was working with my Father. He ownes an aborist company in Maine called Blue Spruce.
                    before that When I was 12. I remeber going to the fairs and seeing these old dudes with big beards pounding on red hot metal. 
                    I for sure thought they were wizards! In some way they were. They took something unuseful and ugly. and turned it into something useful and beautiful.
                    I loved it. So when I was 12 my Father bought me an anvil. I then did everything I could to try to find a mentor who was willing to teach me this craft.
                    luckily I did. I fell in love with blacksmithing. All I did was read about it, watch documentarys about it, and practice it.
                    I then started a little company out of it called Frog Forge. I had buisness cards and even an etsy side. I sold my things at craft fairs and did custom orders.
                    After that I started working for my father full time. Which would be after high school. We worked 10-11 HR days. Brutal in some ways but romantic in others.
                    But I know I don't want to do that line of work forever. I love to learn, and read. Once I get fixated one something and find if somewhat iteresting theres no stoping from there.
